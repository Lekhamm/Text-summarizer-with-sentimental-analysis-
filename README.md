# Text-summarizer-with-sentimental-analysis-
This text summarizer with sentiment analysis offers users the ability to input text manually or upload an image containing text for extraction and summarization. The tool utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. Once the text is extracted, it generates a concise summary. Additionally, the tool employs sentiment analysis techniques to evaluate the emotional tone of the summarized text, providing a percentage breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

In terms of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the tool utilizes chunking to classify the text based on grammatical structures, such as identifying verbs, nouns, pronouns, etc. This enables a deeper understanding of the text's composition and enhances the summarization process.
